# Mission-to-Mars

For this project we are scraping data from various websites to create an new webpage that highlights facts about the planet Mars. To do this I used splinter and beautiful soup libraries to scrape the relevant data, then, transformed the data to a Mongo Database before uploading the data to my webpage using flask. To clean up the web page bootstrap was used.
